Samu's File Summary for ACS source code.

// For the modder's out there, here is a Summary on how the files works.

-) Maps: All of the map scripts. You know this one.
	Each file represents each script of the map.
	If you take a look on the map, it is being imported to the source code,
	in that way, it's better to mantain the code per each map.
	
	*)There is no map for the scripts: sf00, cf06, tw01 and sd03.
	 yet you can use these clusters to create your own maps. :D
	 
-) Core: The main scripts to make the magic of this mod!
	@) f_initDB: All of the variables and constants needed for each map.
	@) f_FinalF: The final fight scripts, and so goes for the ending script. 
	@) f_Battr: It's just the battery/core warning script, nothing intresting. 
	@) f_Core: Same as adobe, but focused on the core, still not intresting. 
	@) f_SecMan: Sector management. For the sector holding scripts!
		This file contains a lot of stuff talking about the sectors like...
		100) Opening sectors (What happens after the count down.)
		102) Losing sectors
		103) Recovering Sectors (and the rewards on doing it.)
		104) Entering and exiting from sectors (after selecting the sector 
		  to travel)
	@) f_ScManS: Sector Management as F_SecMan, except is aimed for Survival 
				 Defender maps.
		100) Wave control (Like the invasion map in Skull--er Zandronum)
	
-) Shop: For the ka-ching and stuff to be selled.
	@) f_PMen: The old global player menu. (Depercharted)
		See the Samu-Terminal for those menus.
	@) f_PMenP: Functions for the old global player menu. (Depercarted)
		See the Samu-Terminal and Samu-Tools for some more functions.
	@) fl_Price: Prices for all of the items in the game!
		(wip) This file will also contain some prices not shown here, 
		      and they're hard coded on Samu-Tools.
			  Just for that guy who says: 
			  "Hey! This is too expensive/cheap, I'll change dat."
			  
	@) f_Cred: Credit and item scripts for the monsters.
		There it is some stuff that you might concern about...
		105) Credit addition display for clietside, look for samu-tools to see 
			 what does those functions over there.
		855) Money bag script. Just show the message and add some more credits.
		500) Monster Kill script, depending on how it died, it will grant money
			 to the player(s). It does'nt matter how.
			 (In that way you can earn money, without doing almost nothing :v)
		Some more named scripts are in there, but they're self explainatory.
		"SF_UniqueDrone") This is to give an unique tid for the drones, to give
						  the money to the respective owners.
		"SF_SpawnADrone") Spawns a drone, keeping track of his master to give
						  some money to him.
		"SF_Net_AddCredits") Net script to give credits to the player
		"SF_Net_AddTeamCredits") Net script to give credits to the commander
		"SF_Net_KillRewardCredits") Net script to give credits depending on 
									the monster.
									
-) Players: Scripts aimed to the players! Including the Refreshing scripts.
	@) f_PHUD: That good-old hud on the center top corner of your screen.
			   It's only visible on full screen mode.
		604) This one will display the actual player's rank 
		605) Displays the background Hud
		616) Displays the Demon-Core's damaging notification.
		617) Announces to the players about the new techs researched 
			 on the commander type maps.
		999) Loop for hud and sbarinfo
		"Hud_ShowCoreHealth") Shows the core health
		"Hud_ShowPlayerStats") Shows the kill, exp and credit count.
		"Hud_ShowTeamCredits_YesCMD") Shows the commander's name
		"Hud_ShowTeamCredits_NoCMD") Shows in case of no player in command.
		"Hud_ShowExperienceBar") Show the experience bar.
		"SyncSBARForEveryone") Syncs items to match up with the sbarinfo
							   in this way, you can see the status of the game
							   even if you're spectating!
		"SyncWithSBARINFO")	Same as adobe, but it sinches when the player
							is in the game.
